# Overview: From Individual Products to Comprehensive Solutions

At this re:Invent, AWS Marketplace announced a strategic shift in software purchasing: moving from buying discrete tools to **"Solution-centric procurement"**.

Today's enterprise customer needs go beyond searching for a specific piece of software. They seek complete **business outcomes**  for example, a comprehensive security solution for healthcare data, or an intelligent manufacturing data analytics system. To meet this demand, AWS Marketplace introduces support for **Multi-product solutions**, allowing Partners to bundle software, services, and data into a single order.

---

## 1. Introducing Multi-product Solutions

This is the latest core feature. **Multi-product solutions** allow AWS Partners (ISVs, Channel Partners, System Integrators) to combine multiple products and services from different vendors into a single solution package.

Instead of customers having to search, evaluate, and purchase each component separately (for example: buying SIEM software from vendor A, purchasing deployment consulting services from vendor B, and buying datasets from vendor C), they can now purchase a complete "Security Operations Center (SOC) Solution" that includes all these components.

Customers can scroll down the details page to view each component in this solution package:

## 2. Streamlined Procurement

One of the biggest barriers when implementing complex solutions is the administrative process. The new feature significantly simplifies this:

* **Single negotiation point:** Customers negotiate pricing and terms for the entire solution package with a single partner.
* **Flexible components:** Despite purchasing as a package, customers can still customize terms and renewals for individual components within the package independently if needed.
* **Centralized governance:** All spending, invoices, and licenses are centrally managed on AWS, making it easy to track budgets and ensure compliance.

Customers can manage contracts for individual components separately while still benefiting from a single approval process:

## 3. Benefits for the Partner Ecosystem

This change opens up significant opportunities for AWS partners:
* **ISV (Independent Software Vendors):** Can combine their software with professional deployment services in a single listing (Example: Okta combining software and deployment services).
* **Channel Partners:** Can combine their own services with ISV products they are authorized to resell (Example: SCC combining services with CrowdStrike products).
* **System Integrators (SI):** Can combine software and services from multiple partners to create complete solutions (Example: Accenture combining their services with Elastic).

## 4. Discovery Experience

To support the "buy solutions" mindset, AWS Marketplace has also improved search capabilities with **Generative AI**. Customers can search based on Use Case or Industry instead of just product names, making it faster to find suitable solutions.

---

## Conclusion

The shift to **Solution-centric procurement** is AWS's strategic move to reduce IT purchasing complexity. It helps enterprises move faster from "having a problem" to "having a solution," eliminating the burden of having to assemble disparate technology pieces themselves.
