### Week 9 Achievements

#### 1. Improved Understanding of Backend Architecture
I gained a strong foundational understanding of how backend systems are structured, including layered architecture, modular design, and how APIs communicate with databases and authentication services. This gave me a clearer picture of how to build scalable and maintainable backend systems.

#### 2. Designed and Documented Initial API Endpoints
I successfully created the first version of the API specification, defining routes, request bodies, response formats, and error handling structures. This helped standardize communication between the backend and other system components.

#### 3. Implemented API Gateway Routing and Configuration
I configured API Gateway to handle HTTP requests, apply method-level settings, enable CORS, attach logging, and prepare integrations for Lambda. This taught me how to connect external requests to internal processing logic securely and efficiently.

#### 4. Built Serverless Functions with AWS Lambda
Using Lambda, I implemented initial backend logic using a serverless approach. I learned how to manage cold starts, structure handler functions, and troubleshoot event inputs and outputs. This provided practical experience in running code without managing servers.

#### 5. Designed and Queried DynamoDB Tables
I learned how DynamoDB organizes data using partition keys and sort keys. I practiced writing queries, scans, and item updates, gaining confidence in managing NoSQL data models within cloud environments.

#### 6. Integrated Authentication Using Cognito
This week, I set up a Cognito User Pool and integrated token-based authentication into API Gateway. I developed an understanding of how identity management and secure access control operate in serverless backend systems.
