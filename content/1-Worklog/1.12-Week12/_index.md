### Week 12 Achievements

#### **1. Implemented Scalable Global State Management**
This week, I integrated a global state manager to coordinate authentication, UI state, and dynamic data. This helped unify session handling and reduce prop drilling.

#### **2. Built a Library of Reusable UI Components**
I created reusable components such as buttons, inputs, modals, loaders, skeletons, and notification toasts. This significantly improves consistency and speeds up future UI development.

#### **3. Successfully Integrated Backend Data Into UI**
I connected frontend elements to live backend data, ensuring views update correctly when users make changes. I also added auto-refresh and manual refresh options.

#### **4. Strengthened Validation & API Data Contracts**
I upgraded backend API validation (Lambda + API Gateway mapping) and added stronger frontend form validation, reducing user errors and ensuring cleaner, more predictable API responses.

#### **5. Optimized Performance & Reduced API Calls**
I implemented caching, memoization, and request deduplication. This reduces network load, speeds up UI interactions, and creates a smoother experience.

#### **6. Prepared Full-Stack Feature Enhancements**
By the end of the week, I completed the foundation needed to build complex full-stack features involving user actions, database updates, and responsive UI behavior.
