# Week 8 Achievements

## Cost Optimization Strategy
- Mastered the differences between **Savings Plans** (more flexible) and **Reserved Instances** (traditional), enabling informed purchasing decisions for each workload type.
- Learned to use the **Recommendations** tool to identify optimal cost commitment levels based on usage history.
- Successfully applied Reserved Instances to RDS databases to reduce long-term operational costs.

## System Resource Optimization
- Successfully deployed **CloudWatch Agent** to collect custom metrics (such as Memory usage) that CloudWatch doesn't provide by default, enabling accurate instance performance assessment.
- Used **AWS Compute Optimizer** to identify over-provisioned or under-provisioned resources and performed appropriate Right Sizing adjustments.

## Cloud Financial Management (FinOps)
- Mastered **AWS Cost Explorer** to visualize cash flow and usage costs by day, month, or specific services.
- Created Custom Reports to track Data Transfer costs - a hidden cost that is often overlooked.
- Understood how to monitor Savings Plan/RI effectiveness through Coverage and Utilization charts.

## Competency Assessment (Midterm)
- Completed the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect** simulation exam.
- Reviewed all foundational knowledge across the 4 main pillars: Compute, Storage, Networking, and Database.
- Identified weak points that need improvement in the following weeks (e.g., Hybrid Cloud scenarios or Advanced Networking).
