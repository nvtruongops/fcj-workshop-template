During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.** from **September 8, 2025** to **December 9, 2025**, I embraced the opportunity to work in a highly professional, disciplined, and growth-oriented environment. This experience not only sharpened my understanding of workplace standards but also helped me develop a stronger professional mindset and a more structured approach to fulfilling assigned responsibilities.

Throughout the program, I contributed to the **Everyonecook** project, where I engaged with tasks that aligned with the team’s development and operational activities. This involvement allowed me to gain practical experience with collaborative workflows and cloud-based development practices within a real project setting.

During the internship, I consistently demonstrated a responsible attitude, adhered closely to organizational processes, and coordinated effectively with colleagues to support shared objectives. I focused on delivering high-quality outcomes while ensuring timely completion of assigned work.
