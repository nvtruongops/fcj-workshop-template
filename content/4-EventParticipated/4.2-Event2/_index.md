# Event Report: AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 — AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

## Event Purpose

- Provide an overview of the AI/ML landscape in Vietnam.
- Introduce core AWS AI/ML services, with a strong focus on Amazon SageMaker.
- Explore Generative AI using Amazon Bedrock, covering foundation models and modern techniques such as RAG and Prompt Engineering.

## Highlights

### Morning Session: Overview of AWS AI/ML Services
- Introduction to the AI/ML context in Vietnam and objectives of the workshop.
- Amazon SageMaker: AWS’s end-to-end platform for building and operating ML solutions.
- Machine learning workflow: data preparation, labeling, training, tuning, and model deployment.
- Built-in MLOps features within SageMaker.
- Live demonstration: guided walkthrough of SageMaker Studio.

### Afternoon Session: Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock
- Foundation Models: comparison and guidelines for selecting models such as Claude, Llama, Titan, and others.
- Prompt Engineering:
  - Advanced methods including Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Few-shot learning.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
  - RAG architecture and integration with external knowledge sources.
- Bedrock Agents: building multi-step workflows and enabling tool integrations.
- Guardrails: best practices for safety controls and content filtering.
- Live demo: creating a Generative AI chatbot using Bedrock.

## Key Takeaways

- **SageMaker:** gained a clear understanding of its role as a complete platform for the ML lifecycle (data preparation → training → deployment).
- **Bedrock & GenAI:** learned how Bedrock manages foundation models, how to evaluate different FM options, and the relevance of techniques such as Prompt Engineering and RAG.
- **Project application:** both RAG and Bedrock Agents provide valuable enhancements for the AI/chatbot features in the Travel-Guided project.
- Live demos offered practical insights into deployment flows and rapid prototyping with Bedrock.

## Event Experience

- The live demos—especially the quick setup of a Bedrock-based chatbot—were particularly impressive.
- The event provided excellent opportunities to network and exchange knowledge with AI/ML professionals in Vietnam.
