# Event Report: AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2 — DevOps on AWS

## Event Purpose

- Strengthen understanding of the **DevOps mindset**, culture, and core principles.
- Introduce AWS services that support CI/CD workflows: CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline.
- Provide an in-depth look into Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using CloudFormation and AWS CDK.
- Explore container technologies (ECS, EKS, App Runner) and observability tools (CloudWatch, X-Ray).

## Highlights

### Morning Session: CI/CD Pipeline & Infrastructure as Code (08:30 – 12:00)

- Revisited DevOps culture with emphasis on DORA metrics such as Deployment Frequency and Mean Time to Recovery.
- CI/CD components:
  - **CodeCommit** for version control and Git workflow comparisons (GitFlow vs. trunk-based).
  - **CodeBuild** for automated building and testing.
  - **CodeDeploy** for deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling).
  - **CodePipeline** for end-to-end automation and orchestration.
- Live demo showcasing a complete CI/CD pipeline from source to deployment.
- IaC topics:
  - **CloudFormation**: templates, stack management, drift detection.
  - **AWS CDK**: constructs, reusable patterns, multi-language support.
- Demo + discussion about choosing between CloudFormation and CDK for different use cases.

### Afternoon Session: Containers, Observability & Best Practices (13:00 – 17:00)

- Container services overview:
  - Docker fundamentals and best practices.
  - **Amazon ECR** for container image storage, security scanning, and lifecycle policies.
  - **ECS & EKS**: orchestration, autoscaling, and deployment strategies.
  - **App Runner**: simplified PaaS-style container deployment.
- Observability:
  - **CloudWatch** for metrics, logs, alarms, and dashboards.
  - **AWS X-Ray** for distributed tracing and microservice debugging.
- Best practices:
  - Feature flags and A/B testing approaches.
  - Incident management and effective postmortems.
- Demo & case study comparing microservice deployment patterns and trade-offs.

## Key Takeaways

- Solidified understanding of DevOps culture, DORA metrics, and automation-driven workflows.
- Learned how AWS Code services integrate to form a complete CI/CD pipeline, along with modern deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary).
- Gained foundational expertise in **CloudFormation** and **AWS CDK**, enabling better template optimization and multi-stack architecture design.
- Recognized the importance of monitoring and observability with CloudWatch and X-Ray for diagnosing issues such as CORS errors and Lambda failures.
- Container technologies (ECS/EKS) provide a strong base for designing more scalable architectures in future projects.
- Hands-on demos improved practical understanding of CI/CD and IaC implementation.

## Event Experience

- The workshop offered a full day of structured, practical learning with a strong emphasis on real-world application.
- Demonstrations and case studies made the concepts easy to map directly into ongoing project work.
- The event also provided valuable opportunities to connect with industry experts and the AWS community.
