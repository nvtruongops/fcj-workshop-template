## 1.2 Project Success Criteria

**Project Success Criteria**

- System availability ≥ 99.9% uptime across all production services (API
  Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFront).

- Page load time \< 2.5 seconds for the main user interface delivered
  through CloudFront and Amplify.

- API response time \< 300 ms for 90% of all user-facing API requests
  under normal traffic conditions.

- AI processing latency \< 5 seconds for recipe suggestions generated by
  AWS Bedrock.

- User authentication success rate ≥ 98% with Cognito handling
  registration, login, and email verification.

- Zero critical security vulnerabilities after security review and WAF
  rules deployment.

- Data durability of 99.999999999% (11 nines) ensured through S3 object
  storage and DynamoDB.

- Scalability to support 10,000+ concurrent users without degradation in
  performance due to serverless infrastructure.

- Operational cost control within target budget: monthly AWS usage not
  exceeding \$200 for production.

- Image upload & processing success rate ≥ 99%, supported by S3, Lambda
  Workers, and SQS.

- Search performance under 1 second (if OpenSearch is enabled) for
  recipe/content search queries.

- Monitoring coverage of 100% critical services using CloudWatch
  dashboards, alarms, and X-Ray tracing.

- CI/CD deployment time \< 5 minutes via GitHub → Amplify and IaC
  automation.

- Zero data loss events, ensured by DynamoDB PITR and S3 versioning.

## 1.3 Assumptions

- The customer will provide full access to their domain registrar
  (Hostinger) to configure DNS delegation to Route 53.

- The customer will provide valid AWS account access with Administrator
  privileges for deployment and configuration.

- All required AWS services (Amplify, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB,
  CloudFront, Cognito, Bedrock, SES) are available and supported in the
  chosen region.

- SES will be successfully moved out of the sandbox and approved for
  production email sending.

- Third-party integrations (GitHub for CI/CD, external email clients,
  image upload sources) will remain available and stable.

- The development team will maintain source code quality and follow the
  architectural guidelines provided by the partner.

- The customer will provide timely feedback and approvals during design,
  testing, and deployment phases.

**Dependencies**

- Reliable internet connectivity is required for all users accessing the
  web application and APIs.

- The system depends on AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for AI recipe
  generation and may experience performance fluctuations if the model
  becomes rate-limited.

- Image upload and processing workflows depend on S3, Lambda, and SQS
  processing reliability.

- If OpenSearch is enabled, search features rely on the availability of
  the OpenSearch domain.

- GitHub Actions and Amplify depend on GitHub service availability.

**Constraints**

- The project will be fully deployed in a single AWS region, which may
  impact latency for users outside the region.

- The solution is designed using serverless patterns; custom EC2-based
  workloads are outside the project scope.

- SES domain reputation may affect email deliverability during initial
  weeks.

- OpenSearch is deployed as a single-node cluster for cost efficiency,
  which means no high availability for search indexing.

- The system must stay within the customer's cost target (\<
  \$200/month), limiting the use of large compute resources.

**Risks**

- SES production approval may be delayed, impacting user onboarding
  emails and notifications.

- If traffic grows unexpectedly, DynamoDB provisioned capacity may
  throttle without timely scaling adjustments.

- AI model cost or latency changes by AWS may impact application
  performance or cost control.

- Misconfigured CloudFront caching could lead to higher latency or
  increased data transfer cost.

- Any incorrect IAM configuration could lead to security risks or
  service disruption.

- Customer team turnover or lack of DevOps skills may slow down future
  maintenance or deployments.

# 2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE / ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM {#solution-architecture-architectural-diagram}

## 2.1 Technical Architecture Diagram

- The proposed solution architecture for the AI-powered cooking social network platform is designed using a fully serverless and scalable AWS cloud-native stack. The architecture ensures high availability,security, and seamless integration between the web frontend, backend APIs, authentication, data storage, and AI recommendation services.
- Below is a description of the key components and how data flows across the system:

**1. Network & Edge Layer**

**Amazon Route 53 (6--7)**  
- Provides DNS routing for the custom domain used by the platform.
- Incoming HTTPS requests from users are resolved and forwarded to
CloudFront.

**Amazon CloudFront (9)**  
- Acts as a global CDN distributing frontend content with low latency while caching static files.

**AWS WAF (8)**  
- Protects the application from common web exploits such as SQL
injection, XSS, and bot attacks.

**2. Frontend Hosting & Deployment**

**AWS Amplify Hosting (4)**  
- Hosts and deploys the Next.js frontend application.  
- Integrated with **GitLab CI/CD (3)** for automated deployments from the development workflow.

**3. Application Layer**

**Amazon Cognito (10)**  
- Handles user authentication and authorization, supporting
email/password and social logins.

**Amazon API Gateway (11)**  
- Serves as the main entry point for backend APIs, exposing REST
endpoints used by the frontend.

**AWS Lambda (12, 15)**  
- Contains the backend business logic, including:

- user management

- post and recipe operations

- ingredient analysis

- connecting to Bedrock for AI recommendations  
  This serverless architecture ensures automatic scaling and pay-per-use
  cost efficiency.

**4. AI Recommendation Layer**

**Amazon Bedrock (16--17)**  
- Provides generative AI capabilities to suggest recipes based on
user-provided ingredients.  
- Lambda invokes Bedrock models (e.g., Claude, Titan) to:

- analyze ingredient lists

- generate recipe suggestions

- classify food categories

- optimize cooking steps.

**5. Data Storage Layer**

**Amazon DynamoDB (13)**  
Stores structured application data such as:

- user profiles

- posts/recipes

- likes & comments

- ingredient metadata.

**Amazon S3 (14)**  
Stores unstructured data:

- recipe images

- user-uploaded food photos

- static content.  
  An S3 bucket is integrated with CloudFront via OAI for secure access.

**6. Observability & Security Layer**

**Amazon CloudWatch (Logs & Metrics)**  
Monitors Lambda performance, API Gateway access logs, and system
metrics.

**AWS X-Ray**  
Performs distributed tracing for API calls and debugging.

**IAM**  
Defines permission boundaries between API, Lambda functions, Bedrock,
DynamoDB, and S3.

**Amazon SES**  
Sends verification emails, notifications, and password recovery
messages.

**Amazon SNS**  
Handles system-level alerts and asynchronous messaging.

**7. Deployment & Infrastructure Management**

**AWS CDK (1--2)**  
Used by developers to define and provision the entire infrastructure
via CloudFormation templates.  
Ensures consistent, reproducible, version-controlled deployments.
![Architecture Diagram](/images/2-Proposal/architecture-diagram.png)


## 2.2 Technical Plan

Partner will develop Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) automation using AWS
CDK (Cloud Development Kit) with TypeScript/Python to provision the
entire cloud environment. This approach ensures quick, consistent, and
repeatable deployments across multiple AWS accounts and environments
(dev, staging, production). All resources such as API Gateway, Lambda
functions, DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, Cognito user pools, Bedrock
integration policies, and CloudFront distributions will be fully
automated via IaC.

Application build and deployment processes for the frontend (Next.js)
will be automated using AWS Amplify Hosting, integrated with GitLab
pipelines. Backend components will be deployed through CDK pipelines to
ensure controlled, versioned, and repeatable releases.

Some additional configuration such as custom domain setup, Route 53 DNS
changes, SSL/TLS certificate issuance, and IAM permission approvals may
require customer review and approval. These changes will follow the
customer\'s existing change management process, including scheduled
maintenance windows and documented approvals from the
security/compliance teams.

All critical paths, including authentication flows, AI recipe suggestion
APIs, data persistence logic, and image upload workflows, will undergo
extensive test coverage. Automated tests (unit, integration, and
API-level) will be executed in CI/CD pipelines, and manual validation
will be performed in the staging environment before production
deployment.

## 2.3 Project Plan

\[Partner\] will adopt the Agile Scrum framework across eight 2-week
sprints. Stakeholders from the team are required to participate in
Sprint Reviews and Sprint Retrospectives to ensure alignment and
continuous improvement.

The proposed team responsibilities are as follows:

- Product Owner: Define user stories, prioritize backlog, and ensure the
  product meets user needs.

- Scrum Master**:** Facilitate Scrum ceremonies, remove blockers, and
  maintain team productivity.

- Development Team: Implement features, conduct unit testing, and
  collaborate on integration.

- AI/ML Specialist: Develop and fine-tune the AI recommendation engine
  that suggests recipes based on user-provided ingredients.

- UI/UX Designer: Design intuitive interfaces and ensure a smooth user
  experience on both web and mobile platforms.

- QA/Testers**:** Validate feature functionality, conduct regression
  testing, and ensure system reliability.

Communication cadences will be established as follows:

- Daily Stand-ups**:** 15-minute meetings for progress updates and
  immediate blockers.

- Sprint Planning**:** At the start of each sprint to prioritize tasks.

- Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint to showcase completed
  features to stakeholders.

- Sprint Retrospective**:** Following each sprint review to identify
  improvements for the next sprint.

Knowledge transfer sessions will be conducted by the senior developers
and AI specialists to ensure team members understand system
architecture, AI integration, and deployment procedures.

## 2.4 Security Considerations

Partner will implement security best practices across the following five
categories to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
the platform:

1.  **Access**

- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user and
  administrative accounts.

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit permissions based
  on user roles (e.g., admin, moderator, contributor).

- Enforce strong password policies and periodic password rotation.

2.  **Infrastructure**

- Deploy the application on secure, managed cloud services (e.g., AWS)
  following AWS security best practices.

- Use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), network segmentation, and security
  groups to isolate resources.

- Regularly patch operating systems and containerized services to
  mitigate vulnerabilities.

3.  **Data**

- Encrypt all data at rest using AWS KMS-managed keys and data in
  transit using TLS/HTTPS.

- Implement data classification to protect sensitive user information
  (e.g., email, profile data, dietary preferences).

- Apply secure data storage and backup procedures to ensure availability
  and integrity.

4.  **Detection**

- Enable AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config to monitor API activity and
  resource configurations.

- Deploy logging and alerting mechanisms to detect unusual or suspicious
  activities in real time.

- Conduct periodic vulnerability scanning and penetration testing on the
  platform.

5.  **Incident Management**

- Establish a formal incident response plan including detection,
  containment, remediation, and communication.

- Maintain audit trails and logs to support forensic investigation if a
  security event occurs.

- Ensure \[Customer\] shares regulatory control validations to help
  \[Partner\] meet all compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, local
  privacy regulations).

By adhering to these measures, Partner ensures that the social cooking
platform remains secure, compliant, and resilient against potential
threats.
